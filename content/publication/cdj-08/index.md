abstract: A gate is called an entangler if it transforms some (pure) product states
  to entangled states. A universal entangler is a gate which transforms all product
  states to entangled states. In practice, a universal entangler is a very powerful
  device for generating entanglements, and thus provides important physical resources
  for accomplishing many tasks in quantum computing and quantum information. This
  paper demonstrates that a universal entangler always exists except for a degenerated
  case. Nevertheless, the problem how to find a universal entangler remains open.
