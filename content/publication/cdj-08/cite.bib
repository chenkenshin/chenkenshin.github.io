 abstract = {A gate is called an entangler if it transforms some (pure) product states to entangled states. A universal entangler is a gate which transforms all product states to entangled states. In practice, a universal entangler is a very powerful device for generating entanglements, and thus provides important physical resources for accomplishing many tasks in quantum computing and quantum information. This paper demonstrates that a universal entangler always exists except for a degenerated case. Nevertheless, the problem how to find a universal entangler remains open.},
