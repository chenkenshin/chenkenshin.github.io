abstract: The LU-LC conjecture is an important open problem concerning the structure
  of entan-glement of states described in the stabilizer formalism. It states that
  two local unitaryequivalent stabilizer states are also local Clifford equivalent.
  If this conjecture were true,the local equivalence of stabilizer states would be
  extremely easy to characterize. Un-fortunately, however, based on the recent progress
  made by Gross and Van den Nest, wefind that the conjecture is false.
