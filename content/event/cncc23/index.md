abstract: 'I will introduce a series of advancements made by the DAMO Academy Quantum Laboratory in the design and implementation of quantum computer systems. We primarily focus on exploring the scalability issues of digital quantum computers and propose a classical architecture tailored for digital quantum computers. By introducing the first scalable real-time decoding framework and configurable qubit control and quantum computing instruction sets, we integrated these technologies into our in-house electronics measurement and control system. Based on this, we have built a complete computing system for the quantum laboratory, which supports the subsequent expansion towards fault-tolerant quantum computing systems.'
