abstract: 'The integration of quantum hardware and software is epitomized by the quantum instruction set, yet a tangible disconnect persists in translating theoretical quantum operations into practical instructions for algorithm deployment and their subsequent realization on actual quantum hardware. This presentation will explore the evolution and optimization of quantum instruction sets, focusing on achieving high-fidelity execution and streamlining quantum algorithm programming. We will specifically examine a range of effective strategies for executing single- and two-qubit operations, which promise to substantially elevate system performance. Additionally, we will highlight the extensive opportunities available for future advancements in the architecture of quantum instruction sets.'
