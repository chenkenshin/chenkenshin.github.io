abstract: 'I will introduce a series of advancements made by the DAMO Academy Quantum Laboratory in the design and implementation of quantum computer systems. We primarily focus on exploring the scalability issues of digital quantum computers and propose a classical architecture tailored for digital quantum computers. By introducing the first scalable real-time decoding framework and configurable qubit control and quantum computing instruction sets, we integrated these technologies into our in-house electronics measurement and control system. Based on this, we have built a complete computing system for the quantum laboratory, which supports the subsequent expansion towards fault-tolerant quantum computing systems.'

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Hugo Blox Builder's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/content-types/) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page.
