title: The First Scalable Real-time Decoding Firmware
summary:  Fast classical processing is essential for most quantum fault-tolerance architectures. We pioneered the slicing-window parallel decoding approach that provides fast classical processing for the surface code through parallelism. This scheme significantly accelerates classical processing by leveraging parallelism, effectively overcoming a major bottleneck in fault-tolerant quantum computing for the first time. Our work has garnered widespread recognition within the scientific community. <font color="#00dddd">It has been featured in presentations at leading institutions like MIT and Duke. Additionally, our team has been honored with an invitation to speak at the QEC23, a prominent conference on quantum error correction.</font>
