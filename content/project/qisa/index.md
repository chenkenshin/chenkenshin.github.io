title: Quantum Instruction Set Design for Superconducting Processors
summary:  The intersection of quantum hardware and software is epitomized in the quantum instruction set, a pivotal factor in system performance. We have been at the vanguard of designing and implementing quantum instruction sets that optimize system efficiency. Our <font color="#00dddd">PMW (Phase-shifted MicroWave) scheme</font> has gained widespread adoption in the industry. Notably, our <font color="#00dddd">SQiSW (Square Root of iSWAP) scheme</font> has been published in the prestigious Physical Review Letters and then adopted by Google. Furthermore, our <font color="#00dddd">recent AshN scheme </font> has been accepted by ASPLOS24 and is currently being implemented by several leading hardware teams.
