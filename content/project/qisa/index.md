title: Quantum Instruction Set Design for Superconducting Processors
summary:  The intersection of quantum hardware and software is epitomized in the quantum instruction set, a pivotal factor in system performance. We have been at the vanguard of designing and implementing quantum instruction sets that optimize system efficiency. Our PMW (Phase-shifted MicroWave) scheme has gained widespread adoption in the industry. Notably, our SQiSW (Square Root of iSWAP) scheme has been published in the prestigious Physical Review Letters and then adopted by Google. Furthermore, our recent AshN scheme has been accepted by ASPLOS24 and is currently being implemented by several leading hardware teams.
