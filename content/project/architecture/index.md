title: The First Prototype System for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing
summary: We developed a prototype system, a trailblazer in supporting fault-tolerant quantum computing. Its design ingeniously addresses scalability, ensuring that control overhead does not increase with the number of qubits. <font color="#0000dd">Integrated with our modular decoding firmware, this system demonstrates unparalleled scalability potential in the realm of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</font> We have established and rigorously tested a comprehensive end-to-end system using our in-house fluxonium quantum chip. This work has been recognized and published in the ***ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing***.
